  <h1>Lachung & Yumthang — North Sikkim excursions</h1>
  <p>Lachung is a picturesque mountain village and a gateway to Yumthang Valley. From Bagdogra we arrange reliable transfers, comfortable stays and local guides to make high-altitude travel safe and memorable.</p>

  <h2>What to expect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Scenic mountain drives with photo stops</li>
    <li>Alpine meadows, especially beautiful in spring</li>
    <li>Local cuisine and village walks</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Because Lachung is higher altitude, we normally recommend an overnight stop in Gangtok to acclimatise after arriving from Bagdogra.</p>
